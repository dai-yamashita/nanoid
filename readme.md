# nanoid

A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for Lua,
ported from JavaScript.

## Installation

```bash
luarocks install nanoid
```

## Usage

The main module uses URL-friendly symbols (A-Za-z0-9_-) and returns
an ID with 21 characters (to have a collision probability similar to UUID v4).

```lua
local nanoid = require('nanoid')

local id = nanoid()
```

If you want to reduce the ID size (and increase collisions probability),
you can pass the size as an argument.

```lua
local id = nanoid(10)
```

### Security

By default, Nano ID uses hardware random bytes generation for security and
low collision probability. If you are not so concerned with security and more
concerned with performance, you can use the faster non-secure generator.

```lua
local nanoid = require('nanoid.non_secure')

local id = nanoid(10)
```

### Custom Alphabet or Size

`custom_alphabet` allows you to create `nanoid` with your own alphabet and ID
size.

```lua
local custom_alphabet = require('nanoid').custom_alphabet

local id = custom_alphabet('1234567890abcdef', 10)
```

`nanoid.non_secure` also contains this function.
